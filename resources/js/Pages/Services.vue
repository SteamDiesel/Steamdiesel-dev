											PHP Frameworks

										<p

											A framework is a base collection of
											“boilerplate” code that is intensely
											boring and unproductive to write.
											Using a framework like laravel
											dramatically accelerates the initial
											development and deployment of
											websites and applications.
										</p>
										<p
											class="
												text-base text-zinc-600
												dark:text-zinc-400
											"
										>
											Almost the entire internet runs on
											PHP, and both Laravel and WordPress
											are great options for serving web
											pages to your visitors. Both have
											their strengths and weaknesses, so
											I'll help you choose which is the
											most appropriate platform to suit
											your plans.
										</p>
										<h4

											APIs
										</h4>
										<p
											class="
												text-base text-zinc-600
												dark:text-zinc-400
											"
										>
											Application Program Interface(s). An
											API is a resource that other
											programs can use to access the data
											they need. An API is a collection of
											“endpoints”, for example; the google
											maps API offers many endpoints,
											including one that receives a string
											of text and returns a list of
											matching addresses.
										</p>
										<p
											class="
												text-base text-zinc-600
												dark:text-zinc-400
											"
										>
											Your website or application can have
											an API, and I can build that for
											you. You might have a wholesale
											collection of T-Shirts and want to
											make your entire catalogue including
											pricing and stock levels available
											to your retail partners, an API is a
											great way to provide real-time data.
											REST or GraphQL APIs are the most
											common, but there will also be media
											streaming and database direct
											connections too. I can work with all
											of them to build your next website
											or app.
										</p>
										<h4
											class="
												text-base
												italic
												mt-4
												text-zinc-800
												dark:text-zinc-100
											"
										>
											Webhooks
										</h4>
										<p
											class="
												text-base text-zinc-600
												dark:text-zinc-400
											"
										>
											Similar to an API, a webhook is like
											a “listener”. It's a special link on
											your site that other web services
											use to send updates to your site.
											For instance, if you use
											<a
												class="
													font-semibold
													text-indigo-600
												"
												href="http://stripe.com/"
												target="_blank"
												rel="noopener noreferrer"
												>Stripe</a
											>
											for your subscription billing,
											webhooks allow your site to listen
											for alerts from stripe if a users
											card declines or cancels their
											subscription, allowing your system
											to automatically suspend service,
											send an email or anything else you
											want your app to do.

											Hyper-Text Markup Language is what
											the web-browser interprets to
											display a webpage for your site's
											visitor. A web page is a document
											that contains both the content and
											instructions for how to display that
											content. This document is written in
											HTML.

										<p
											class="

											For a website to rank highly in
											search results, the HTML needs to
											follow best practice conventions for
											information structure and
											readability. Getting page structure
											right is fundamental to Search
											Engine Optimisation (SEO).

											It's time to make it interesting and
											enjoyable for your site visitor to
											consume. By adding attractive fonts,
											graphics and colour, you give your
											reader visual cues that enrich the
											content of your site (and not
											distract from it!).

											In most cases 'Less is more' for

											Javascript

											class="

										>
											Javascript makes web pages do cool
											and interesting stuff.
											<br />
											With Javascript a webpage page can:
										</p>
										<ul
											class="
												text-base text-zinc-600
												dark:text-zinc-400
											"
										>
											<li>
												Fetch data from other sites,
												servers, APIs or resources
											</li>
											<li>
												Change the page content in
												response to user input
											</li>
											<li>
												Do math, such as calculating
												loan repayments or shopping cart
												totals
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p
											class="
												text-base text-zinc-600
												dark:text-zinc-400
											"
										>
											Javascript is a whole programming
											language that runs almost the entire
											internet. I work with the VueJS
											Javascript framework to build
											everything from page widgets and
											popout menus to Progressive web apps
											that look and feel like native
											windows, iOS and Android
											applications.
